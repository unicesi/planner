# PISCIS project repository

The dynamic nature of current software execution environments demands a reliable and prompt response to guarantee quality at runtime. Self-adaptive software systems contain facilities that allow for an autonomous and continuous adaptation towards such end. The facilities are, overall, structured in accordance with IBM’s MAPE-K reference model. IBM’s MAPE-K reference model comprises a Monitor and an Analyzer to sense and interpret context data, a Planner and an Executor to create and apply structural adaptation plans, and a Knowledge Manager to manage and share relevant information. Piscis is an implementation for a Planner built on the principles of constraint satisfaction. PISCIS is in charge of dynamically creating structural adaptation action plans for self-adaptive enterprise applications following the MAPE-K reference model.

# Repository structure

# ToolSupport

This folder contains the code base for the Eclipse Plug-ins that support the process of finding a Resolution model. The implementation includes the representation for the two input models (Quality Configuration and Decision Model), and the plug-in that allows to initiate the process and evaluate the optimun resolution model.

# Execute
Download and open the project in Eclipse EMF Mars. Run as Eclipse Application and follow the steps described in the user documentation. The user documentation is currently in spanish and is linked to the current release.
